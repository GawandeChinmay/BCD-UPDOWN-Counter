# BCD-UPDOWN-Counter
A synchronous BCD Up/Down Counter designed in Verilog HDL that counts from 0–9 in Binary-Coded Decimal format. The counter increments or decrements based on a control signal, wraps around at boundary values, and includes clock and reset inputs. Suitable for simulation and FPGA/VLSI implementation in digital systems.
